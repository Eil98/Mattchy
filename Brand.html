In 1956 the company starts being referred to as Australian as it dips into tennis clothing: starring top of the line textures, its high-quality production delves into Italian long-standing care for details and fabrics. Australian catalog could be split in two: on one side the Hardcourt line stands as a well-balanced range of sport-underground items inspired to the '90s, on the other the Sportswear collection reworks signature styles mixing significant graphics elements with modern influences. Bearing all, the Italian brand endorsed Ivan Lendl and Goran Ivanisevic taking taped pants, color-blocking prints and Australian logo branding on the courts from all over the world.</p><br>

<p>In 1889 Hamilton Carhartt founded its own company of workwear in Detroit, the heart of American industrial revolution: this was the very first strep of Carhartt brand as we know it today, a sheer benchmark of modern workwear and a street culture staple. Following the "Honest value for an honest dollar" motto, it started producing a wide range of garments to meet railway men's needs: endurance, efficiency and durability were the key words for the very first Carhartt jackets, useful gears for the heavy lifting that were universally appreciated for a large variety of details, like the four-pocket Chore Coat - a timeless classic since 1923.</p><br>

Dickie, Dickies began manufacturing vehicle and harness and turned into a workwear company just after the II World War: their gears became widespread due to peerless durability and endurance, pushing the American brand into that exclusive group of workwear labels influencing the street culture.</p><br>

Sport has been quickly becoming the main form of expression in the '70s and this Italian brand has been able to exploit its unmatched vision and managerial creativity to become a worldwide renowned tennis sportswear colossus: the company's philosophy stands out clear in the creative director idea of giving birth to products able to complement and not overpower the athletes. </p><br>

<p>In 1920 Ehrhardt Koch opted to chase his own American dream founding New Era, a casual caps & hats company. As the label manufactured the first baseball caps ever for the Cleveland Indians, 1934 was the pivotal year to enter the sports market: many MLB teams commissioned the entire hats production to this New York society, that in 1933 obtained even the privilege to fabricate and distribute the merchandising of the entire league, including future collections dedicated to NFL, NBA and NHL teams. The New Era sportswear leadership has been confirmed by a series of new game-changing innovations that have reshaped the idea of snapback itself: in 1954, for instance, the 59fifty cap debuted, becoming the very first peaked cap with a large-scale distribution, while the 39thirty is now generally known as the first cap equipped with an elastic strap on the back.</p><br>

It all starts with the Blue Ribbon Sport, that was a company in charge of importing and selling a massive selection of celebrated Japanese running sneakers: years and years spent producing shoes for the Olympic Games led to the creation of Nike Inc. in 1971 next to Portland, Oregon. Nike breaks into the market with Cortez gaining an immediate success during the 1972 Olympics: the originals structure consists of a sturdy foam midsole along with a heel lining to decrease stress impact and setting brand-new comfort standards. A series of minimal details (like the legendary Swoosh logo) is taken after the wings of the so-called "Samothrace" Greek goddess of victory and round off that USA-colored model</p><br>

After building a solid background in extreme sports by jumping from tricks in Venice Beach to surf sessions in Long Beach, Nixon exploited all its experience to figure out watches, backpacks and a massive assortment of accessories to pimp your look: Time Teller is its flagship model, an analogue watch supplied with a water-resistant stainless steel case that you could pair with different wristbands, matching it to the outfit of the day </p><br>

Every collection clearly shows the social and political commitment of the founder, a great street artist that is still used to speaking his mind and supporting free speech and thought: it's easy to remember the worldwide famous four-color printing for the Obama election campaign, but nothing beats the iconic white-on-red Obey logo, which comes from John Carpenter's "They Live".</p><br>

Technical fabrics and a modern color palette did the rest, legitimizing Patagonia leading role all over the world: now it's also considered a truly appreciated lifestyle brand, with its personal flair and different lines that range from running to surf, from mountain technical stuff to everyday clothes </p><br>

Foster & Sons was one of the first company ever to craft running shoes equipped with spikes, but it definitely break through in 1958, after merging with Reebok: the Boston-based brand gained a resounding success as fast as the African antelope it's named after, skipping steps and introducing always new technologies. Reebok Freestyle ruled the early '80s, reign of aerobic and fitness: over the next few years, it dealt with other fields, building the very first feeling with tennis and basketball. Changing Reebok logo in 1986 - a sleeker, plainer design instead of the Union Jack flag - was just the first step of a deep restyling: Reebok became the favorite of popular athletes like Venus Williams, Ryan Giggs and Shawn Kemp, a sort of casual, versatile alternative to outdated sport kicks. </p><br>

<p>In 1980 Shawn Stussy started producing surfboards in California, signing firsthand every single item with a black marker due to its graffiti background. In 1984 he joins his forces with Frank Sinatra Jr. establishing an apparel brand that produces white blank bucket caps with the Stussy logo on the front, nothing but a double woven "s" along with a "Stussy No. 4" writing mocking the Chanel slogan: the Stussy saucy and witty attitude seduces even the East Coast after the first official store opening in New York in 1991, all thanks to the collaboration of James Jebbia, the future founder of the now mythical Supreme skating brand. The influence of cultural excitements from back then and the frequent Shawn foreign trips affect his approach to fashion, baiting different personalities around this emerging brand: the Stussy Tribe was born, just an heterogeneous group of young talented kids sharing common passions, ideals and targets and exchanging opinions and pieces of advice</p><br>

<p>Founded in 1966 just few meters away from the sunny Californian beaches by the ecologist businessman Douglas Thompkins, The North Face was named after the coldest and most arduous mountains' slope, the hardest to climb. During the '60s, The North Face manufactured technical mountain apparel and outdoor tools for climbing, winning the hearts of great rock climbers all over the world: hence the motto "Never Stop Exploring", the course of action behind every The North Face technology. Starting from late '80s, bright colors and all-over graphics of skiing clothing spread through streets, expressing the will to express ideas of an entire generation. </p><br>
